Bayesian model components for price elasticity analysis.

This package provides Bayesian hierarchical models functionality by
re-exporting components from the parent 'model' module and providing
bayesian-specific implementations:

Components:
- model_builder.py: Model structure and parameter initialization (bayesian-specific)
- Other components are imported from the parent module

# Import other components from top-level module
